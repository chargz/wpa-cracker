# A WPA-Cracker implementation using Docker.

Functionality - A .cap file placed in "hash" is put through an aircrack-ng attempt, with the wordlist being 'wget' directly off the internet.
All this is run in a Docker container, which is configured for automated builds - everytime there's a push to this repository.
